## Interpretation

### Clinical Implications
1. **Disease Prediction**: Significant sex bias detected in disease prediction models
2. **Variant Calling**: Significant difference in variant calling accuracy between sexes
3. **Healthcare Equity**: Bias patterns suggest potential for high impact on clinical decision-making

### Technical Recommendations
1. **Model Training**: 
   - Implement sex-stratified training datasets
   - Use balanced male/female reference panels
   - Apply sex-aware calibration techniques

2. **Quality Control**:
   - Monitor sex-specific performance metrics
   - Implement bias detection in CI/CD pipelines
   - Regular auditing of deployed models

3. **Reference Genome Strategy**:
   - Develop pan-sex reference frameworks
   - Use sex-matched references when possible
   - Implement bias correction algorithms

## Next Steps
1. Validate findings with real-world datasets
2. Develop bias mitigation algorithms
3. Create sex-aware quality metrics
4. Establish bias monitoring protocols
